# porrima

An open source healthcare management app, aimed to organize and assist in the process of interacting with the healthcare system.

## Developers 

The team for this project is comprised of students at UNC-CH.

## Documentation

Documentation for API endpoints, UI usage, and planning can be found in the [docs](https://github.com/comp426-2022-spring/a99-porrima/tree/main/docs) folder.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository containing your code and documentation and a prototype release package. Your project should take the form of a Node package, with all of the attendant items associated with that. The following three script commands should work in your package:

### Install dependencies in package
`npm install` - Install [dependencies](https://github.com/comp426-2022-spring/a99-porrima#dependencies) for your package.<br />

### Run tests on server
`npm test` - Start app, check that everything can run, and then stop app.<br />

### Start app/system
`npm start` - In the a99-porrima directory. Run on port 3000. <br />
`cd porrima-app` - Move into the react app. <br />
`npm start` - Start the react app. Will be prompted to run on different port. Select 'y'. <br />
Your team is responsible for incorporating the following specifications and deliverables into your final project:

1. Back-end specifications
    * API built on whatever framework you choose. You can build an API that interacts with other APIs as well in order to integrate them.
    * API root endpoint at http://HOST/app/.
    * Should create (if nonexistent) and interact with a database of users and interactions (this can be logs, even). These can be separate databases for different microservices or separate tables in one database. It is up to your teamâ€™s decisions.
    * Database can be of any type you choose.
2. Front-end specifications
    * Give users the ability to register an account, update their information, see their information somewhere, and delete their account.
    * Interactions with the front end should be logged in a database.
3. Database specifications
    * User database - registration details (username, email address, etc.)
    * Interaction database - details of user interactions (login history, access logs, etc.)
4. Documentation
    * License documenation - Choose a license and include it in the repository just like we have been.
    * README.md file with basic descriptiong, installation requirements/instructions, dependency list, run instructions
/docs/ directory containing full documentation of every available API endpoint that you create for your app. This directory shoud also house an archive of your planning documentation.
    * Code comments (preferably referring to the documentation)
    * User instructions in the interface
5. Demo video to be presented in class on either 21 or 26 April
6. Self/group evaluation (Individual group members: this is part of the final exam for the course.)
